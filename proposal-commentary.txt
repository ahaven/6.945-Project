- Are you doing type discovery, or are you writing a typed scheme?
+ We're doing a system that doesn't require you to have everything typecheck and
  you can add new types dynamically.

- Are you trying to write a particular inferencer, or some general "analysis
  framework"?
+ blah
  
- What features of type systems do you plan to support? Keep in mind that
  inference is impossible for some.
  
- Propagators is a good fit, since you'll be doing a lot of monotonic inference,
  but in types you have both co- and contra-variance. How are you going to
  handle this?
+ Cells with both a type upper bound and a lower bound. (So... intervals, kind
  of)
  E.g.:
  f : A -> B
  g : C -> D
  f type:< g <-> B type:< D and C type:< A

- There are type polymorphisms other than HM parametric polymorphisms. Any plans
  for those?

- Hint: Invent a partial information structure that uses unification as merge.
