Commentary by Pavel and GJS   (3)

- Are you doing type discovery, or are you writing a typed scheme?
- Are you trying to write a particular inferencer, or some general "analysis
  framework"?
- What features of type systems do you plan to support? Keep in mind that
  inference is impossible for some.
- Propagators is a good fit, since you'll be doing a lot of monotonic inference,
  but in types you have both co- and contra-variance. How are you going to
  handle this?
- There are type polymorphisms other than HM parametric polymorphisms. Any plans
  for those?

- Hint: Invent a partial information structure that uses unification as merge.
